## Conference Presentations

### 2025

**Polarity inversion operators in PLM**  
*29th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL)*  
Vienna, Austria | January 2025  
David Kletz, Pascal Amsili, and Marie Candito

**Abstract:** We investigate whether pretrained language models encode negation compositionally by training multilayer perceptrons to transform contextual representations to simulate polarity inversion. Our results suggest the existence of regularities compatible with the hypothesis of a unique compositional operator.

**Key Points:**
- Analysis of compositional encoding of negation in PLMs
- Development of MLP-based transformation methods
- Mathematical exploration of operator composition properties

**Swushroomsia at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Probing LLMs' Collective Intelligence for Multilingual Hallucination Detection**

Co-located with a major *ACL conference | 2025  
Sandra Mitrović, Joseph Cornelius, David Kletz, Ljiljana Dolamic, and Fabio Rinaldi

**Abstract:** We present a system for multilingual hallucination detection that leverages the collective intelligence of multiple LLMs to identify factual inconsistencies in generated text.

**Key Points:**
- Ensemble approach using multiple LLMs
- Multilingual hallucination detection
- Performance comparison with proprietary models

*10th Workshop on Financial Technology and Natural Language Processing (FinNLP)*  
Co-located with a major *ACL conference | 2025  
Oscar Lithgow-Serrano, David Kletz, et al.

**Abstract:** We develop a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating RAG systems on financial documents, comparing four state-of-the-art architectures including graph-based and traditional retrieval approaches.

**Key Points:**
- Systematic evaluation of RAG architectures
- Domain-specific challenges in finance
- Graph-based knowledge retrieval methods

**Better Together: Towards Localizing Fact-Related Hallucinations using Open Small Language Models**  
*CHOMPS Workshop*  
December 2025  
David Kletz, Sandra Mitrović, Ljiljana Dolamic, and Fabio Rinaldi

**Abstract:** We propose a method for fine-grained hallucination detection at the sentence level using combinations of open-source small language models, demonstrating competitive performance with large proprietary models.

**Key Points:**

### 2024

**The Self-Contained Italian Negation Test (SCIN)**  
*10th Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLiC-it 2024)*  
Pisa, Italy | December 2024  
Viola Gullace, David Kletz, Thierry Poibeau, Alessandro Lenci, and Pascal Amsili

**Abstract:** We extend the Self-Contained Negation Test to Italian, evaluating how Italian pretrained language models handle semantic constraints imposed by negation.

**Key Points:**
- Multilingual extension of negation evaluation methodology
- Cross-linguistic comparison of model behavior
- Italian-specific linguistic phenomena

### 2023

**The Self-Contained Negation Test Set**  
*6th BlackboxNLP Workshop: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP*  
Singapore | December 2023  
Co-located with EMNLP 2023  
David Kletz, Pascal Amsili, and Marie Candito

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel evaluation methodology based on minimal pairs to assess whether pretrained language models have acquired knowledge of semantic constraints imposed by negation. Our self-contained test reveals that only very large generative models (LLMs like GPT-4) achieve near-perfect performance.

**Key Points:**
- Novel minimal-pair evaluation methodology
- Semantic constraint acquisition in PLMs
- Performance correlation with model size and training protocol

**Slides:** [Available upon request]

**Probing structural constraints of negation in Pretrained Language Models**  
*24th Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)*  
Tórshavn, Faroe Islands | May 2023  
David Kletz, Marie Candito, and Pascal Amsili

**Abstract:** We investigate whether pretrained language models encode structural constraints imposed by negation, focusing on the licensing of negative polarity items. Using probing classifiers, we demonstrate that contextual embeddings encode information about structural zones defined by negation scope.

**Key Points:**
- Probing methodology for structural linguistic knowledge
- Negative polarity item licensing
- Syntactic-semantic interface in neural models

**Slides:** [Available upon request]

**EvoSem: A database of polysemous cognate sets**

Singapore | December 2023  
Co-located with EMNLP 2023  
Mathieu Dehouck, Alex François, Siva Kalyan, Martial Pastor, and David Kletz

**Abstract:** We present EvoSem, a publicly available database designed for studying semantic evolution across language families through polysemous cognate sets.

**Key Points:**
- Diachronic semantic shift detection
- Cross-linguistic semantic evolution
- Computational approaches to historical linguistics

### 2022

**A Methodology for Building a Diachronic Dataset of Semantic Shifts and its Application to QC-FR-Diac-V1.0, a Free Reference for French**  
*13th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC)*  
Marseille, France | June 2022  
David Kletz, Philippe Langlais, François Lareau, and Patrick Drouin

**Abstract:** We propose a methodology for constructing diachronic datasets to study semantic shifts over time. We apply this methodology to create QC-FR-Diac-V1.0, a reference dataset for French covering newspapers from 1850 to 2000.

**Key Points:**
- Automatic semantic shift detection methodology
- Diachronic corpus construction
- Resource creation for French language evolution
