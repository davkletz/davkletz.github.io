## Teaching Philosophy

I conceive teaching as a space of experimentation where adaptation is central, both in terms of content and pedagogical methods themselves. In my practice, I strive to give students an active role during sessions, favoring participatory approaches that have proven particularly beneficial for their learning.

My approach to teaching computational linguistics is firmly rooted in the theoretical foundations of language sciences. I believe that effective NLP education must articulate linguistic theory with computational methodologies, rather than treating them as separate domains.

## Teaching Interests & Future Directions

### For Bachelor's Level (Licence)
I am prepared to teach foundational computer science courses:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Python programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

These fundamental courses are essential for building the foundations necessary for advanced learning in AI and NLP in graduate cycles.

### For Master's Level

**NLP for Non-CS Backgrounds:**  
I particularly enjoy teaching computational linguistics as a branch of language sciences, articulating linguistic theory with computational methods. My three years of experience at Sorbonne Nouvelle and ENEAD with students from linguistics, digital humanities, and descriptive linguistics backgrounds has shown me the value of this approach.

**Advanced NLP with Strong Practical Component:**  
I would like to develop advanced NLP courses with extensive hands-on work, including multiple TD sessions where students implement complete language models from scratch. My Master 2 course at Rouen represents a first step in this direction that I would like to deepen.

**Interdisciplinary Approach:**  
I aim to create courses that bridge theoretical linguistics and computational implementation, showing students how linguistic insights can inform better NLP systems and how computational methods can test linguistic theories.

## Supervision Philosophy

I view supervision as a fundamentally collaborative endeavor. I attach particular importance to the construction of the internship topic: it must integrate coherently with my research projects while corresponding to the student's profile, skills, and aspirations.

This approach requires attentive listening to the supervisee and constant dialogue to identify relevant directions together. Supervision thus involves genuine intellectual co-construction, where regular exchanges allow us to collectively define project stages, analyze obtained results, and provide necessary methodological support.
