## Teaching Experience Overview

**Total Teaching Hours:** 450 hours equivalent TD (2020-2024)

I have taught across three countries (France, Canada, Switzerland) at universities including:
- SUPSI (Lugano, Switzerland)
- Université Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris, France)
- Université de Rouen Normandie (Rouen, France)  
- Université de Montréal (Montréal, Canada)

My courses span from Bachelor's (Licence 3) to Master's level (Master 2), covering computational linguistics, natural language processing, corpus linguistics, and computer science fundamentals.

**Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa & ENS-PSL, Paris**  
*November 2023 - June 2024*

**Topic:** Study of the impact of context polarity on encoding in contextual embeddings  

**Outcomes:**
- Viola's Master's thesis 


#### Viola Gullace (First Internship)
**Università di Pisa & ENS-PSL, Paris**  
*February - May 2023*

**Topic:** How Do Pretrained Language Models Deal with Negation? The case of Italian  


**Outcomes:**
- Viola's Master's thesis defended and validated at Università di Pisa
- Published paper at CLiC-it 2024 (10th Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics)


#### Leo Rongieras
**Université Paris Cité, Master**
